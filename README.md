The AR Vending Machine represents a Vending Machine game that was created by Aaron Hernandez and Tz-Ruei Liu. 

## Rules
You can load any number of pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, or dollar bills into the vending machine. The monetary amounts of each food item are randomized between $0.75 to $3.75, and are shown by hovering over the food item. You can use the clear button to "Return Change" and set the amount in the machine back to $0. When you click on the appropriate food picture with the right amount of money, it will be dispensed! Then click anywhere to take the food!
